R Scripts for Sentiment Analysis
--------------------------------

> These scripts are an adaptation of [Jeffrey Breen's Twitter example](http://jeffreybreen.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/twitter-text-mining-r-slides/ "slideshow").

> Included are several useful txt files of bad and good words. These particular lists are modeled for a forum to measure comments being more or less clinical in nature.
